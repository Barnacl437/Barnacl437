html/css _minor_ literation. I made a simple css file out of some css sample codes from the internet and made it a bit monospaced paranoid-ish looking. just a silly test tho, but you can find it in my [github.io repo](https://github.com/barnacl437/barnacl437.github.io). enjoy!!!1!1!111!111!11!1!!!

I mostly use [WTFPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTFPL) or no licence on my projects. They are mostly for fun perhaps, so the licence should be also fun and short af xddd
