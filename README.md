16 yo, he/him/any, who likes tech.
nothing special in the GitHub profile so uh...

I use both Windows/Linux but currently Door.
Trying to learn Python in a very slow state.

I mostly use WTFPL or no licence on my projects. They are mostly for fun perhaps, so the licence should be also fun and short af xddd
