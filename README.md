16 yo, he/him/any, a native Vietnamese, your talking bush (lel), who likes tech. sometimes be funny and be funky.
nothing special in the GitHub profile so uh...

I use both Windows/Linux but currently Door.
Trying to learn Python in a very slow state. Other linguas not planned yet.

Also knows Windows Batch in basic. I aim to learn Bash later too.

html/css minor literation. I made a simple css file out of a css sample codes from the internet and made it a bit monospaced paranoid-ish looking. just a silly test tho.

I mostly use [WTFPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTFPL) or no licence on my projects. They are mostly for fun perhaps, so the licence should be also fun and short af xddd

and hey, I am generally friendly, talkative, a little smart-ass seeming but still reachable. I accept open friend requests, so feel free to talk to me on my "supported" social platforms, a complete list is available [here](https://barnacl437.github.io/#social-links).
