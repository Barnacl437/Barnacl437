nothing special in the GitHub profile so uh...

 I use both Windows/Linux but currently Door.
Trying to learn Python in a very slow state. Other linguas not planned yet.

Also knows Windows Batch in basic. I aim to learn Bash later too.

Being a translator is not really hard, I recently submitted a (kinda) complete vi translation to an emulation project not gonnuh mention here. Yes I meant you can just understand at least English and your local speak (if any). Might be a boring, wasting time, if you think so, but nvm am enjoying it rn so uhhh

html/css _minor_ literation. I made a simple css file out of some css sample codes from the internet and made it a bit monospaced paranoid-ish looking. just a silly test tho, but you can find it in my [github.io repo](https://github.com/barnacl437/barnacl437.github.io). enjoy!!!1!1!111!111!11!1!!!

I mostly use [WTFPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTFPL) or no licence on my projects. They are mostly for fun perhaps, so the licence should be also fun and short af xddd

and hey, I am generally friendly, talkative, a little smart-ass seeming but still reachable ~~(yes i am smartass)~~. I accept open friend requests, so feel free to talk to me on my "supported" social platforms, a complete list is available [here](https://barnacl437.github.io/#social-links).
